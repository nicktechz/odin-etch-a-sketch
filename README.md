# ETCH-A-SKETCH

Etch-A-Sketch is a front-end development project built using basic technologies like HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

This project is part of "The Odin Project" in its foundations module.

## Include a Music Player

In this project, I wanted to experiment a bit by using the Javascript `.play()` function to add background music. Initially, it is muted due to DOM handling reasons, but you can activate it using the button on the right.
